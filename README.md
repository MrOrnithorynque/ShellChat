//Not working for the moment (will update soon)
# ShellChat (In progress)
ShellChat is a little program to chat with your friend and play simple games within the same network.</br>
*(will MAYBE update to enable chat trough internet)*

# How to use :
- Build the project
  > make

  Two binaries will be created :
  > Binaries</br>
  > ├───ShellChat_server</br>
  > └───ShellChat_client</br>

- Launch the server binary
  > ./ShellChat_server [IP ADRESS] [PORT]
  
  And wait for the client(s) to connect.
 
- Launch the client binary
  > ./ShellChat_client [IP ADRESS] [PORT]

# What is comming next ?
## Games
Yes, I want the possibility to play with other users on the same game. </br>
__But, which games ?__ </br>
  - Connect4
  - Tron
  - CityBomber (RTX EDITION)
  - And maybe a SFML game.
 
## Windows/Mac/Linux compatibility
I want to dockerise the app, I'm not sure if I will take the time to do it but for the moment it is in a side of my head.
